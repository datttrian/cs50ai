    "Let’s start answering this with a Harry Potter example. Consider the\n",

    "2. Harry visited Hagrid or Dumbledore today, but not both.\n",
    "3. Harry visited Dumbledore today.\n",

    "Based on these three sentences, we can answer the question “did it rain\n",
    "today?”, even though none of the individual sentences tells us anything\n",
    "about whether it is raining today. Here is how we can go about it:\n",
    "looking at sentence 3, we know that Harry visited Dumbledore. Looking at\n",

    "thus we can conclude\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Harry did not visit Hagrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, looking at sentence 1, we understand that if it didn’t rain, Harry\n",
    "would have visited Hagrid. However, knowing sentence 4, we know that\n",
    "this is not the case. Therefore, we can conclude\n",
    "\n",
    "5. It rained today.\n",
    "\n",
    "To come to this conclusion, we used logic, and today’s lecture explores\n",

    "## First Order Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "First order logic is another type of logic that allows us to express\n",
    "more complex ideas more succinctly than propositional logic. First order\n",
    "logic uses two types of symbols: *Constant Symbols* and *Predicate\n",
    "Symbols*. Constant symbols represent objects, while predicate symbols\n",
    "are like relations or functions that take an argument and return a true\n",
    "or false value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we return to the logic puzzle with different people and\n",
    "house assignments at Hogwarts. The constant symbols are people or\n",
    "houses, like Minerva, Pomona, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, etc. The predicate\n",
    "symbols are properties that hold true or false of some constant symbols.\n",
    "For example, we can express the idea that Minerva is a person using the\n",
    "sentence Person(Minerva). Similarly, we can express the idea the\n",
    "Gryffindor is a house using the sentence House(Gryffindor). All the\n",
    "logical connectives work in first order logic the same way as before.\n",
    "For example, ¬House(Minerva) expresses the idea that Minerva is not a\n",
    "house. A predicate symbol can also take two or more arguments and\n",
    "express a relation between them. For example, BelongsTo expresses a\n",
    "relation between two arguments, the person and the house to which the\n",
    "person belongs. Thus, the idea that Minerva belongs to Gryffindor can be\n",
    "expressed as BelongsTo(Minerva, Gryffindor). First order logic allows\n",
    "having one symbol for each person and one symbol for each house. This is\n",
    "more succinct than propositional logic, where each person—house\n",
    "assignment would require a different symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Universal Quantification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantification is a tool that can be used in first order logic to\n",
    "represent sentences without using a specific constant symbol. Universal\n",
    "quantification uses the symbol ∀ to express “for all.” So, for example,\n",
    "the sentence ∀x. BelongsTo(x, Gryffindor) → ¬BelongsTo(x, Hufflepuff)\n",
    "expresses the idea that it is true for every symbol that if this symbol\n",
    "belongs to Gryffindor, it does not belong to Hufflepuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Existential Quantification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Existential quantification is an idea parallel to universal\n",
    "quantification. However, while universal quantification was used to\n",
    "create sentences that are true for all x, existential quantification is\n",
    "used to create sentences that are true for at least one x. It is\n",
    "expressed using the symbol ∃. For example, the sentence ∃x. House(x) ∧\n",
    "BelongsTo(Minerva, x) means that there is at least one symbol that is\n",
    "both a house and that Minerva belongs to it. In other words, this\n",
    "expresses the idea that Minerva belongs to a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existential and universal quantification can be used in the same\n",
    "sentence. For example, the sentence ∀x. Person(x) → (∃y. House(y) ∧\n",
    "BelongsTo(x, y)) expresses the idea that if x is a person, then there is\n",
    "at least one house, y, to which this person belongs. In other words,\n",
    "this sentence means that every person belongs to a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other types of logic as well, and the commonality between them\n",
    "is that they all exist in pursuit of representing information. These are\n",
    "the systems we use to represent knowledge in our AI."
