# [Traffic](#traffic)

The latest version of Python you should use in this course is Python
3.11, as newer versions of Python are not yet fully compatible with some
Python modules used in this course. **This is particularly the case for
this project, due to interactions with TensorFlow**.

Write an AI to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph.

## [Background](#background)

As research continues in the development of self-driving cars, one of
the key challenges is [computer
vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), allowing these
cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital
images. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and
distinguish road signs – stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and
more.

In this project, you’ll use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to
build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those
signs. To do so, you’ll need a labeled dataset: a collection of images
that have already been categorized by the road sign represented in them.

Several such data sets exist, but for this project, we’ll use the
[German Traffic Sign Recognition
Benchmark](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news)
(GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different
kinds of road signs.

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

- Download the distribution code from
    <https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2023/x/projects/5/traffic.zip> and unzip
    it.
- Download the [data
    set](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2023/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip) for this
    project and unzip it. Move the resulting `gtsrb` directory inside of
    your `traffic` directory.
- Inside of the `traffic` directory, run
    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install this project’s
    dependencies: `opencv-python` for image processing, `scikit-learn`
    for ML-related functions, and `tensorflow` for neural networks.

## [Understanding](#understanding)

First, take a look at the data set by opening the `gtsrb` directory.
You’ll notice 43 subdirectories in this dataset, numbered `0` through
`42`. Each numbered subdirectory represents a different category (a
different type of road sign). Within each traffic sign’s directory is a
collection of images of that type of traffic sign.

Next, take a look at `traffic.py`. In the `main` function, we accept as
command-line arguments a directory containing the data and (optionally)
a filename to which to save the trained model. The data and
corresponding labels are then loaded from the data directory (via the
`load_data` function) and split into training and testing sets. After
that, the `get_model` function is called to obtain a compiled neural
network that is then fitted on the training data. The model is then
evaluated on the testing data. Finally, if a model filename was
provided, the trained model is saved to disk.

The `load_data` and `get_model` functions are left to you to implement.

## [Specification](#specification)

Complete the implementation of `load_data` and `get_model` in
`traffic.py`.

- The `load_data` function should accept as
    an argument `data_dir`, representing the path to a directory where
    the data is stored, and return image arrays and labels for each
    image in the data set.
  - You may assume that `data_dir` will
        contain one directory named after each category, numbered `0`
        through `NUM_CATEGORIES - 1`. Inside each category directory
        will be some number of image files.
  - Use the OpenCV-Python module (`cv2`)
        to read each image as a `numpy.ndarray` (a `numpy`
        multidimensional array). To pass these images into a neural
        network, the images will need to be the same size, so be sure to
        resize each image to have width `IMG_WIDTH` and height
        `IMG_HEIGHT`.
  - The function should return a tuple
        `(images, labels)`. `images` should be a list of all of the
        images in the data set, where each image is represented as a
        `numpy.ndarray` of the appropriate size. `labels` should be a
        list of integers, representing the category number for each of
        the corresponding images in the `images` list.
  - Your function should be
        platform-independent: that is to say, it should work regardless
        of operating system. Note that on macOS, the `/` character is
        used to separate path components, while the `\` character is
        used on Windows. Use
        [`os.sep`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) and
        [`os.path.join`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join)
        as needed instead of using your platform’s specific separator
        character.
- The `get_model` function should return a
    compiled neural network model.
  - You may assume that the input to the
        neural network will be of the shape `(IMG_WIDTH, IMG_HEIGHT, 3)`
        (that is, an array representing an image of width `IMG_WIDTH`,
        height `IMG_HEIGHT`, and `3` values for each pixel for red,
        green, and blue).
  - The output layer of the neural
        network should have `NUM_CATEGORIES` units, one for each of the
        traffic sign categories.
  - The number of layers and the types of
        layers you include in between are up to you. You may wish to
        experiment with:
    - different numbers of
            convolutional and pooling layers
    - different numbers and sizes of
            filters for convolutional layers
    - different pool sizes for pooling
            layers
    - different numbers and sizes of
            hidden layers
    - dropout
- In a separate file called *README.md*,
    document (in at least a paragraph or two) your experimentation
    process. What did you try? What worked well? What didn’t work well?
    What did you notice?

Ultimately, much of this project is about exploring documentation and
investigating different options in `cv2` and `tensorflow` and seeing
what results you get when you try them!

You should not modify anything else in `traffic.py` other than the
functions the specification calls for you to implement, though you may
write additional functions and/or import other Python standard library
modules. You may also import `numpy` or `pandas`, if familiar with them,
but you should not use any other third-party Python modules. You may
modify the global variables defined at the top of the file to test your
program with other values.

## [Hints](#hints)

- Check out the official [Tensorflow Keras
    overview](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview) for some
    guidelines for the syntax of building neural network layers. You may
    find the lecture source code useful as well.
- The
    [OpenCV-Python](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/d2/d96/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_imgproc.html)
    documentation may prove helpful for reading images as arrays and
    then resizing them.
- Once you’ve resized an image `img`, you
    can verify its dimensions by printing the value of `img.shape`. If
    you’ve resized the image correctly, its shape should be
    `(30, 30, 3)` (assuming `IMG_WIDTH` and `IMG_HEIGHT` are both `30`).
- If you’d like to practice with a smaller
    data set, you can download a [modified
    dataset](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2023/x/projects/5/gtsrb-small.zip)
    that contains only 3 different types of road signs instead of 43.

## [Testing](#testing)

If you’d like, you can execute the below (after [setting up
`check50`](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/projects/check50/en/latest/index.html)
on your system) to evaluate the correctness of your code. This isn’t
obligatory; you can simply submit following the steps at the end of this
specification, and these same tests will run on our server. Either way,
be sure to compile and test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 ai50/projects/2024/x/traffic
```

Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using `style50`.

``` highlight
style50 traffic.py
```

Remember that **you may not import any modules** (other than those in
the Python standard library) **other than those explicitly authorized
herein**. Doing so will not only prevent `check50` from running, but
will also prevent `submit50` from scoring your assignment, since it uses
`check50`. If that happens, you’ve likely imported something disallowed
or otherwise modified the distribution code in an unauthorized manner,
per the specification. There are certainly tools out there that
trivialize some of these projects, but that’s not the goal here; you’re
learning things at a lower level. If we don’t say here that you can use
them, you can’t use them.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

Beginning
<a href="https://time.cs50.io/20240101T000000-0500" class="alert-link"
data-local="2024-01-01T00:00:00-05:00">Monday, January 1, 2024 at 12:00
AM EST</a>, the course has transitioned to a new submission platform. If
you had not completed CS50 AI prior to that time, **you must join the
new course pursuant to Step 1, below**, and also must resubmit all of
your past projects using the new submission slugs to import their
scores. We apologize for the inconvenience, but hope you feel that
access to `check50`, which is new for 2024, is a worthwhile trade-off
for it, here!

1. Visit [this
    link](https://submit.cs50.io/invites/d03c31aef1984c29b5e7b268c3a87b7b),
    log in with your GitHub account, and click **Authorize cs50**. Then,
    check the box indicating that you’d like to grant course staff
    access to your submissions, and click **Join course**.

2. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and, optionally,
    [install `submit50`](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/submit50/).

3. If you’ve installed `submit50`, execute

    ``` highlight
    submit50 ai50/projects/2024/x/traffic
    ```

    Otherwise, using Git, push your work to
    `https://github.com/me50/USERNAME.git`, where `USERNAME` is your
    GitHub username, on a branch called `ai50/projects/2024/x/traffic`.

If you submit your code directly using Git, rather than `submit50`, **do
not** include the `gtsrb` directory as part of your submission. (It’s
too large, and the autograder will almost certainly time-out trying to
deal with it.) `submit50` will automatically exclude this for you.

Work should be graded within five minutes. You can then go to
<https://cs50.me/cs50ai> to view your current progress!
