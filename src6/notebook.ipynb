    "**Syntax** is sentence structure. As native speakers of some human\n",

    "flagging non-grammatical sentences as wrong. For example, the sentence\n",
    "“Just before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room”\n",
    "is grammatical, whereas the sentence “Just before Sherlock Holmes nine\n",
    "o’clock stepped briskly the room” is non-grammatical. Syntax can be\n",
    "grammatical and ambiguous at the same time, as in “I saw the man with\n",
    "the telescope.” Did I see (the man with the telescope) or did I see (the\n",
    "man), doing so by looking through the telescope? To be able to parse\n",
    "human speech and produce it, the AI needs to command syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantics** is the meaning of words or sentences. While the sentence\n",
    "“Just before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room”\n",
    "is syntactically different from “Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into\n",
    "the room just before nine o’clock,” their content is effectively\n",
    "identical. Similarly, although the sentence “A few minutes before nine,\n",
    "Sherlock Holmes walked quickly into the room” uses different words from\n",
    "the previous sentences, it still carries a very similar meaning.\n",

    "## Word Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to represent word meanings in our AI. As we’ve seen before, it\n",
    "is convenient to provide input to the AI in the form of numbers. One way\n",
    "to go about this is by using **One-Hot Representation**, where each word\n",
    "is represented with a vector that consists of as many values as we have\n",
    "words. Except for a single value in the vector that is equal to 1, all\n",
    "other values are equal to 0. How we can differentiate words is by which\n",
    "of the values is 1, ending up with a unique vector per word. For\n",
    "example, the sentence “He wrote a book” can be represented as four\n",
    "vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $1, 0, 0, 0$ (he)\n",
    "- $0, 1, 0, 0$ (wrote)\n",
    "- $0, 0, 1, 0$ (a)\n",
    "- $0, 0, 0, 1$ (book)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while this representation works in a world with four words, if\n",
    "we want to represent words from a dictionary, when we can have 50,000\n",
    "words, we will end up with 50,000 vectors of length 50,000. This is\n",
    "incredibly inefficient. Another problem in this kind of representation\n",
    "is that we are unable to represent similarity between words like “wrote”\n",
    "and “authored.” Instead, we turn to the idea of **Distributed\n",
    "Representation**, where meaning is distributed across multiple values in\n",
    "a vector. With distributed representation, each vector has a limited\n",
    "number of values (much less than 50,000), taking the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $-0.34, -0.08, 0.02, -0.18, …$ (he)\n",
    "- $-0.27, 0.40, 0.00, -0.65, …$ (wrote)\n",
    "- $-0.12, -0.25, 0.29, -0.09, …$ (a)\n",
    "- $-0.23, -0.16, -0.05, -0.57, …$ (book)\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to generate unique values for each word while using\n",
    "smaller vectors. Additionally, now we are able to represent similarity\n",
    "between words by how different the values in their vectors are.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You shall know a word by the company it keeps” is an idea by J. R.\n",
    "Firth, an English linguist. Following this idea, we can come to define\n",
    "words by their adjacent words. For example, there are limited words that\n",
    "we can use to complete the sentence “for \\_\\_\\_ he ate.” These words are\n",
    "probably words like “breakfast,” “lunch,” and “dinner.” This brings us\n",
    "to the conclusion that by considering the environment in which a certain\n",
    "word tends to appear, we can infer the meaning of the word."
