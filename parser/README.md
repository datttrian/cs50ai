## [Background](#background)

A common task in natural language processing is parsing, the process of
determining the structure of a sentence. This is useful for a number of
reasons: knowing the structure of a sentence can help a computer to
better understand the meaning of the sentence, and it can also help the
computer extract information out of a sentence. In particular, it’s
often useful to extract noun phrases out of a sentence to get an
understanding for what the sentence is about.

In this problem, we’ll use the context-free grammar formalism to parse
English sentences to determine their structure. Recall that in a
context-free grammar, we repeatedly apply rewriting rules to transform
symbols into other symbols. The objective is to start with a nonterminal
symbol `S` (representing a sentence) and repeatedly apply context-free
grammar rules until we generate a complete sentence of terminal symbols
(i.e., words). The rule `S -> N V`, for example, means that the `S`
symbol can be rewritten as `N V` (a noun followed by a verb). If we also
have the rule `N -> "Holmes"` and the rule `V -> "sat"`, we can generate
the complete sentence `"Holmes sat."`.

Of course, noun phrases might not always be as simple as a single word
like `"Holmes"`. We might have noun phrases like `"my companion"` or
`"a country walk"` or `"the day before Thursday"`, which require more
complex rules to account for. To account for the phrase
`"my companion"`, for example, we might imagine a rule like:

``` highlight
NP -> N | Det N
```

In this rule, we say that an `NP` (a “noun phrase”) could be either just
a noun (`N`) or a determiner (`Det`) followed by a noun, where
determiners include words like `"a"`, `"the"`, and `"my"`. The vertical
bar (`|`) just indicates that there are multiple possible ways to
rewrite an `NP`, with each possible rewrite separated by a bar.

To incorporate this rule into how we parse a sentence (`S`), we’ll also
need to modify our `S -> N V` rule to allow for noun phrases (`NP`s) as
the subject of our sentence. See how? And to account for more complex
types of noun phrases, we may need to modify our grammar even further.

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

- Download the distribution code from
    <https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2023/x/projects/6/parser.zip> and unzip it.
- Inside of the `parser` directory, run
    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install this project’s
    dependency: `nltk` for natural language processing.

## [Understanding](#understanding)

First, look at the text files in the `sentences` directory. Each file
contains an English sentence. Your goal in this problem is to write a
parser that is able to parse all of these sentences.

Take a look now at `parser.py`, and notice the context free grammar
rules defined at the top of the file. We’ve already defined for you a
set of rules for generating terminal symbols (in the global variable
`TERMINALS`). Notice that `Adj` is a nonterminal symbol that generates
adjectives, `Adv` generates adverbs, `Conj` generates conjunctions,
`Det` generates determiners, `N` generates nouns (spread across multiple
lines for readability), `P` generates prepositions, and `V` generates
verbs.

Next is the definition of `NONTERMINALS`, which will contain all of the
context-free grammar rules for generating nonterminal symbols. Right
now, there’s just a single rule: `S -> N V`. With just that rule, we can
generate sentences like `"Holmes arrived."` or `"He chuckled."`, but not
sentences more complex than that. Editing the `NONTERMINALS` rules so
that all of the sentences can be parsed will be up to you!

Next, take a look at the `main` function. It first accepts a sentence as
input, either from a file or via user input. The sentence is
preprocessed (via the `preprocess` function) and then parsed according
to the context-free grammar defined by the file. The resulting trees are
printed out, and all of the “noun phrase chunks” (defined in the
Specification) are printed as well (via the `np_chunk` function).

In addition to writing context-free grammar rules for parsing these
sentences, the `preprocess` and `np_chunk` functions are left up to you!

## [Specification](#specification)

Complete the implementation of `preprocess` and `np_chunk`, and complete
the context-free grammar rules defined in `NONTERMINALS`.

- The `preprocess` function should accept a
    `sentence` as input and return a lowercased list of its words.
  - You may assume that `sentence` will
        be a string.
  - You should use `nltk`’s
        [`word_tokenize`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#nltk.tokenize.punkt.PunktLanguageVars.word_tokenize)
        function to perform tokenization.
  - Your function should return a list of
        words, where each word is a lowercased string.
  - Any word that doesn’t contain at
        least one alphabetic character (e.g. `.` or `28`) should be
        excluded from the returned list.
- The `NONTERMINALS` global variable should
    be replaced with a set of context-free grammar rules that, when
    combined with the rules in `TERMINALS`, allow the parsing of all
    sentences in the `sentences/` directory.
  - Each rules must be on its own line.
        Each rule must include the `->` characters to denote which
        symbol is being replaced, and may optionally include `|` symbols
        if there are multiple ways to rewrite a symbol.
  - You do not need to keep the existing
        rule `S -> N V` in your solution, but your first rule must begin
        with `S ->` since `S` (representing a sentence) is the starting
        symbol.
  - You may add as many nonterminal
        symbols as you would like.
  - Use the nonterminal symbol `NP` to
        represent a “noun phrase”, such as the subject of a sentence.
- The `np_chunk` function should accept a
    `tree` representing the syntax of a sentence, and return a list of
    all of the noun phrase chunks in that sentence.
  - For this problem, a “noun phrase
        chunk” is defined as a noun phrase that doesn’t contain other
        noun phrases within it. Put more formally, a noun phrase chunk
        is a subtree of the original tree whose label is `NP` and that
        does not itself contain other noun phrases as subtrees.
    - For example, if `"the home"` is a
            noun phrase chunk, then `"the armchair in the home"` is not
            a noun phrase chunk, because the latter contains the former
            as a subtree.
  - You may assume that the input will be
        a `nltk.tree` object whose label is `S` (that is to say, the
        input will be a tree representing a sentence).
  - Your function should return a list of
        `nltk.tree` objects, where each element has the label `NP`.
  - You will likely find the
        documentation for
        [`nltk.tree`](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/tree.html)
        helpful for identifying how to manipulate a `nltk.tree` object.

You should not modify anything else in `parser.py` other than the
functions the specification calls for you to implement, though you may
write additional functions and/or import other Python standard library
modules. You will need to modify the definition of `NONTERMINALS`, but
you should not modify the definition of `TERMINALS`.

## [Hints](#hints)

- It’s to be expected that your parser may
    generate some sentences that you believe are not syntactically or
    semantically well-formed. You need not worry, therefore, if your
    parser allows for parsing meaningless sentences like
    `"His Thursday chuckled in a paint."`
  - That said, you should avoid
        over-generation of sentences where possible. For example, your
        parser should definitely not accept sentences like
        `"Armchair on the sat Holmes."`
  - You should also avoid
        under-generation of sentences. A rule like
        `S -> N V Det Adj Adj Adj N P Det N P Det N` would technically
        successfully generate sentence 10, but not in a way that is
        particularly useful or generalizable.
  - The rules in the lecture source code
        are (intentionally) a very simplified rule set, and as a result
        may suffer from over-generation. You can (and should) make
        modifications to those rules to try to be as general as possible
        without over-generating. In particular, consider how you might
        get your parser to accept the sentence “Holmes sat in the
        armchair.” (and “Holmes sat in the red armchair.” and “Holmes
        sat in the little red armchair.”), but have it *not* accept the
        sentence “Holmes sat in the the armchair.”
- It’s to be expected that your parser may
    generate multiple ways to parse a sentence. English grammar is
    inherently ambiguous!
- Within the
    [`nltk.tree`](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/tree.html)
    documentation, you may find the `label` and `subtrees` functions
    particularly useful.
- To focus on testing your parser before
    working on noun phrase chunking, it may be helpful to temporarily
    have `np_chunk` simply return an empty list `[]`, so that your
    program can operate without noun phrase chunking while you test the
    other parts of your program.

## [Testing](#testing)

If you’d like, you can execute the below (after [setting up
`check50`](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/projects/check50/en/latest/index.html)
on your system) to evaluate the correctness of your code. This isn’t
obligatory; you can simply submit following the steps at the end of this
specification, and these same tests will run on our server. Either way,
be sure to compile and test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 ai50/projects/2024/x/parser
```

Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using `style50`.

``` highlight
style50 parser.py
```

Remember that **you may not import any modules** (other than those in
the Python standard library) **other than those explicitly authorized
herein**. Doing so will not only prevent `check50` from running, but
will also prevent `submit50` from scoring your assignment, since it uses
`check50`. If that happens, you’ve likely imported something disallowed
or otherwise modified the distribution code in an unauthorized manner,
per the specification. There are certainly tools out there that
trivialize some of these projects, but that’s not the goal here; you’re
learning things at a lower level. If we don’t say here that you can use
them, you can’t use them.
