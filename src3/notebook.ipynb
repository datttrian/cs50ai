    "searches by moving to a neighboring node. This type of algorithm is\n",
    "different from previous types of search that we saw. Whereas in maze\n",

    "local search is interested in finding the best answer to a question.\n",
    "Often, local search will bring to an answer that is not optimal but\n",

    "In this illustration, we are seeing a possible configuration of houses\n",
    "and hospitals. The distance between them is measured using Manhattan\n",
    "distance (number of moves up, down, and to the sides; discussed in more\n",
    "detail in lecture 0), and the sum of the distances from each house to\n",
    "the nearest hospital is 17. We call this the **cost**, because we try to\n",
    "minimize this distance. In this case, a state would be any one\n",
    "configuration of houses and hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstracting this concept, we can represent each configuration of houses\n",
    "and hospitals as the state-space landscape below. Each of the bars in\n",

    "    minimize the distance from houses to hospitals).\n",
    "- A **Current State** is the state that is\n",

    "    current state can transition to. In the one-dimensional state-space\n",
    "    landscape above, a neighbor state is the state to either side of the\n",
    "    current state. In our example, a neighbor state could be the state\n",

    "    step. Neighbor states are usually similar to the current state, and,\n",
    "    therefore, their values are close to the value of the current state.\n",
