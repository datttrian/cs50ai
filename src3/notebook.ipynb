    "\n",
    "Local search is a search algorithm that maintains a single node and\n",
    "searches by moving to a neighboring node. This type of algorithm is\n",
    "different from previous types of search that we saw. Whereas in maze\n",
    "solving, for example, we wanted to find the quickest way to the goal,\n",
    "local search is interested in finding the best answer to a question.\n",
    "Often, local search will bring to an answer that is not optimal but\n",
    "“good enough,” conserving computational power. Consider the following\n",
    "example of a local search problem: we have four houses in set locations.\n",
    "We want to build two hospitals, such that we minimize the distance from\n",
    "each house to a hospital. This problem can be visualized as follows:\n",

    "![Houses and Hospitals](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/notes/3/hospitals1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this illustration, we are seeing a possible configuration of houses\n",
    "and hospitals. The distance between them is measured using Manhattan\n",
    "distance (number of moves up, down, and to the sides; discussed in more\n",
    "detail in lecture 0), and the sum of the distances from each house to\n",
    "the nearest hospital is 17. We call this the **cost**, because we try to\n",
    "minimize this distance. In this case, a state would be any one\n",
    "configuration of houses and hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstracting this concept, we can represent each configuration of houses\n",
    "and hospitals as the state-space landscape below. Each of the bars in\n",
    "the picture represents a value of a state, which in our example would be\n",
    "the cost of a certain configuration of houses and hospitals.\n",

    "![State-Space Landscape](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/notes/3/statespace.png)\n",

    "Going off of this visualization, we can define a few important terms for\n",
    "the rest of our discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **Objective Function** is a function\n",
    "    that we use to maximize the value of the solution.\n",
    "- A **Cost Function** is a function that we\n",
    "    use to minimize the cost of the solution (this is the function that\n",
    "    we would use in our example with houses and hospitals. We want to\n",
    "    minimize the distance from houses to hospitals).\n",
    "- A **Current State** is the state that is\n",
    "    currently being considered by the function.\n",
    "- A **Neighbor State** is a state that the\n",
    "    current state can transition to. In the one-dimensional state-space\n",
    "    landscape above, a neighbor state is the state to either side of the\n",
    "    current state. In our example, a neighbor state could be the state\n",
    "    resulting from moving one of the hospitals to any direction by one\n",
    "    step. Neighbor states are usually similar to the current state, and,\n",
    "    therefore, their values are close to the value of the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the way local search algorithms work is by considering one\n",
    "node in a current state, and then moving the node to one of the current\n",
    "state’s neighbors. This is unlike the minimax algorithm, for example,\n",
    "where every single state in the state space was considered recursively."
